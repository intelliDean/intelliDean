# Hey, I'm Dean 👋

### Rust · Blockchain · Protocol Engineering · DevRel

I build at the intersection of **performance, privacy, and decentralisation** — writing production Rust, shipping smart contracts across EVM and beyond, and turning complex protocol mechanics into things developers actually understand and enjoy using.

Currently focused on: **Arbitrum Stylus** · **Monad** · **ZK/Privacy infrastructure**

## 🔨 What I Ship

| Project | Description | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| [**Stylus Trace**](https://github.com/intelliDean/stylus-trace) | High-performance profiling tool for Arbitrum Stylus transactions | `Rust` `Arbitrum Stylus` |
| [**PhantomBet**](https://github.com/intelliDean/PhantomBet) | Privacy-first decentralised prediction market with AI-powered settlement | `Rust` `Solidity` `ZK` |
| [**The Arbiter**](https://github.com/intelliDean/the-arbiter) | Autonomous AI referee protocol on Monad Blockchain | `Rust` `Monad` `AI` |
| [**Payego**](https://github.com/intelliDean/payego) | High-throughput fintech payment engine | `Rust` |

## 🧠 What I Care About

- **Devtools that don't suck** — if a protocol is hard to debug or profile, I'll build the tool that fixes that
- **Privacy as a primitive** — not an afterthought
- **Making hard things legible** — writing and speaking about ZK, Rust, and on-chain systems so other engineers can move faster
- **Protocol engineering** — I care about what's happening at the consensus and execution layer, not just the application layer

## ✍🏾 Writing

I write deep technical content on [Medium](https://intellidean.medium.com/) covering:

- Zero-knowledge proofs and their real-world tradeoffs  
- Rust performance patterns for blockchain systems  
- Decentralised architecture and protocol design

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I'm actively looking for **DevRel roles** at protocol teams, L1/L2s, and dev tooling companies where I can bridge deep technical work and developer community building.
