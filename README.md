# Hey, I'm Dean 👋

### Rust · Blockchain · Protocol Engineering · ZK Research Engineering

Performance is non-negotiable. Privacy is a right. Decentralisation is the point. I build at that intersection — and when the tools don't exist to build it right, I stop and build those first. Production Rust, cross-chain protocols, and the writing that makes it all make sense to other developers.

Currently focused on: **Protocol Engineering** · **ZK/Privacy infrastructure** · **Devtooling**

## 🧠 What I Care About

- **Devtools that don't suck** — if a protocol is hard to debug or profile, I'll build the tool that fixes that
- **Privacy as a primitive** — not an afterthought
- **Making hard things legible** — writing and speaking about ZK, Rust, and on-chain systems so other engineers can move faster
- **Protocol engineering** — I care about what's happening at the consensus and execution layer, not just the application layer

## ✍🏾 Writing

I write deep technical content on [Medium](https://intellidean.medium.com/) covering:

- Zero-knowledge proofs and their real-world tradeoffs  
- Rust performance patterns for blockchain systems  
- Decentralised architecture and protocol design

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I'm actively looking **collaborate** with teams, L1/L2s, and dev tooling companies where I can bridge deep technical work and expertise.
